=================================
 nzbsort - unix-style nzb sorter
=================================

Sort your NZB files alphabetically before downloading them. This will allow
you to stream/uncompress the files in the right order and possibly pipe 
the output to a media player.

This tool was designed to be simple and work with stdin/stdout. Here are
a few examples, all doing the same thing::

    $ nzbsort < original.nzb > output.nzb
    $ nzbsort original.nzb > output.nzb
    $ cat original.nzb | nzbsort > output.nzb

The output XML is ugly but hey, it's XML, news reader don't give a shit.
